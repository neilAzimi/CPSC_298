# Document: Week 3 Assignment
## Name: Neil Azimi
## Course: CPSC298-LLM

## Learning Experience:
I learned that very detailed commands are often recieved better by V0, especially when you provide it your intentions
with creating a certain feature of the app. It took me about 10 minutes to configure the app, but the time consuming part
of this assignment for me was figuring out how to deploy it and upload it to Github. I feel that I have a much better
understanding of how upstream works now though. 

I also learned how to fix the 400 error my webhook created every time it tried to post the github commit to discord.
I did this by adding /github to the end of the webhook URL.
